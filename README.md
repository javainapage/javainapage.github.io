Java is a **programming language** and a **platform** .
---

## Java, the platform

To get started you need JDK (Java Dev Kit).  
Namely OpenJDK. There are other forks too, maybe.  
But you'll end up using OpenJDK, trust me on this.  

JDK is consists of JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which contains JVM (Java Virtual Machine) on which java "runs".  

For beginning, you need two cli tools bundles with jdk;
`$ javac` : compiles source code ".java" files to ".class" files  
`$ java` : executes the program on JVM  



    #Where should I download Java?

    With the introduction of the new release cadence, many have asked where they should download Java, and if it is still free. To be clear, YES — Java is still free.

    If you would like to download Java for free, you can get OpenJDK builds from the following vendors, among others:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jdk.java.net">Oracle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download/">RedHat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/">Azul</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">AdoptOpenJDK</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/">Amazon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/">SAP</a><br></li>
<li><a href="https://bell-sw.com/">Liberica JDK</a><br></li>
</ul>
