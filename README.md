Java is a **programming language** and a **platform** .
---

## Java, the platform

To get started you need JDK (Java Dev Kit).  
Namely OpenJDK. There are other forks too, maybe.  
**But you'll end up using OpenJDK, trust me on this.**  

JDK is consists of JRE (Java Runtime Environment);  
JRE contains JVM (Java Virtual Machine);  
java "runs" on JVM.    

For beginning, you need two cli tools bundles with jdk;  
`$ javac` : compiles source code ".java" files to ".class" files  
`$ java` : executes the program on JVM  



    #Where should I download Java?

    With the introduction of the new release "cadence",
    many have asked where they should download Java, 
    and if it is still free. 
    To be clear, YES — Java is still free.

    If you would like to download Java for free, 
    you can get OpenJDK builds from the following vendors, 
    among others:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jdk.java.net">Oracle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download/">RedHat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/">Azul</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">AdoptOpenJDK</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/">Amazon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/">SAP</a><br></li>
<li><a href="https://bell-sw.com/">Liberica JDK</a><br></li>
</ul>

**But you'll end up using Oracle, trust me on this.**

## Hello World!

Java code goes into ".java" (files).  

Quickly make "hello.java" file in a folder named "jiap".  

```bash
mkdir jiap
cd jiap
touch hello.java
vi hello.java
```

Open .java file in an editor (here vim).  
Write the following into it.  

```java
class HelloWorld{
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
```

Open terminal in the same folder.  
Run.  

```bash
javac hello # compiles java
ls # a new hello.class file is created
java hello #run the class file
```

OUTPUT :

    Hello World!
