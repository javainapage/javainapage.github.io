## Java, the platform

1. JVM, JRE, JDK

JVM executes _java bytecode_,  
**subset to JRE**;  
JRE is built-in language support,  
here are libraries and stuff,  
**subset to JDK**;  
JDK is all what a dev needs,  
javac _the compiler_,  
java _the executor_,  
all tooling;


2. JDK (java dev kit)  

well there are two of these now,  
OpenJDK, OracleJDK;  
once they made no difference,  
now they do,  
none knows why, (~corporate~)  
but some say licensing,  
OpenJDK is truly open,  
but trust me,  
**you'll end up using Oracle JDK !**  

3. more to it, there are **editions**

    - Java SE (yup, simple)
    - Jakarta EE (oh! you work at corporate!)
    - Java ME (android devs caution here!)

4. later you'll explore frameworks

  

## Trivia to bore , you and me ...

- Java is a **programming language** and a **platform** . 

- Compiles to **java bytecode**, runs on **java virtual machine** .
    - source ---compile-> bytecode ---JVM-> execution 

- _"FORCED OOP"_, describes java in a phrase .

> "first day i met java, there was classes, there was `main` but in a class, the class was itself in a class which extended another class."

- CamelCase is the norm, and it sucks

- and dot notation...

> "you.want.it.darker?"  
"we.kill.the.flame"  
-Leonard Cohen (who codes in java)
 
- you'll soon need build tools like maven, ~~ant~~ or gradle.
    - npm of java world [=> (Objections!)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38388824/is-maven-similar-to-npm)






## The Roadmap

> linear roadmaps are the best roadmaps, and only these work ! - UNESCO

1. Part 1

    - .java file
    - Let There be a class !
        - curly braces syntax
    - a `main` to run (`static`, but why?)
    - Hello World !
    - `$ java` & `$ javac` 

2. Part 2

    - Types (of course!)
    - Access Specifiers
        - why `main` is static?
    - `static` block
        - before java 1.6
    - methods (`!functions`)

*OO! Its OOP*

3. Part 3

    - Constructor (yep you know)
    - No Destructor (now you will know)
        - why? (spoiler; gc!)
        - finalise() (caution)
